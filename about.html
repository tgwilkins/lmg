        My name is Les and I am based in Wantage. I am available for many jobs
        around the house or in the garden including general maintenance, fixes
        and small home improvements.

        I have held various positions as a gardener and general handyman. I
        started my career as a bricklayer and have been involved in numerous
        projects including the building of Marks and Spencer in Oxford.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been employed as a gardener for over 20 years, and I am now at an
        age where I would like to work to my own schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small jobs around the house and garden are easily put off, many people
        do not have the time to get these things done. This is where I come in,
        as I have vast experience in many areas around the home and garden.
